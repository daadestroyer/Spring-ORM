SpringORM
----------
1. Where spring is framework and ORM is tool like hibernate
2. ORM is basically Object Relational Model Tool like Hibernate
3. It's just like integration of ORM with Spring 


Advantages of Using ORM:-
-------------------------
1. Less coding required (Less than hibernate also)
2. Easy to test
3. Better exception handling 
4. You can also handle exception by yourself also
5. Integrated transaction management


Working with Database:-
-----------------------

Traditional approach(OLD approach):-
----------------------
Our java program call JDBC code and then JDBC code call Database then Database return response to JDBC and from jdbc we will get our data.

Using ORM:-
-----------
ORM also internally uses JDBC but we don't have to know about that thing

1. Create a particular class for database table
2. Then you have to map all columns of class to database table
3. Now if you want object you simply get from ORM and then you get data
4. There is no required to write query for creating class also 
5. To work with JDBC in spring we have jdbcTemplate and if you want to use ORM with spring now you have 
   Hibernate Template 
6. Hibernate template have many methods like save , get , load , update you need only Hibernate Template   
   class only
